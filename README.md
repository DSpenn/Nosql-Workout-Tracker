# Unit 18 Nosql Homework: Workout Tracker

## User Story

* As a user, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.

## Description
Deployed with Heroku using MongoDB Atlas
https://limitless-sea-12074.herokuapp.com/stats

## Acceptance Criteria

When the user loads the page, they should be given the option to create a new workout or continue with their last workout.
The user should be able to:

  * Add exercises to the most recent workout plan.
  * Add new exercises to a new workout plan.
  * View the combined weight of multiple exercises from the past seven workouts on the `stats` page.
  * View the total duration of each workout from the past seven workouts on the `stats` page.
  * The URL to the deployed application
  * The URL to the GitHub repository

> **Important:** Look into using a MongoDB aggregate function to dynamically add up and return the total duration for each workout. Check out the [MongoDB documentation on the $addFields](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/addFields/), the [MongoDB documentation on the $sum operator](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/sum/), and the [Mongoose documentation on aggregate functions](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/api.html#aggregate_Aggregate) to learn how it can be accomplished.
